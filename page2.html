               Hi! I'm <span>YANG</span>
            </h2>
            <p>A dedicated Bachelor of Science in Computer Science student who is passionate about web development and software. 
                My curiosity about technology started in high school when we had a project that our prof made us which is the movement
                 of a stick man using computer and because of that I started to be interested in technology and curious about many things about
                 technology, when I realized how much I enjoy it. In my senior year, I chose the STEM strand to lay a solid foundation 
                 for my future career in technology. <br> In my early college years, I struggled significantly with coding due to my limited knowledge
                about algorithms and mathematics. This lack of foundation caused frustration and self-doubt because it was difficult to understand 
                more complicated ideas in programming. However, I am grateful of the dedication that allowed me to overcome these challenges and advance in my education.</p>
